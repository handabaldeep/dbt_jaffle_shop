# dbt Jaffle Shop Project
Example project to learn and play around with dbt.

## dbt core with BigQuery

As a getting started project, I am trying the [dbt Core with BigQuery](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/quickstarts/dbt-core/manual-install) tutorial.

The datasets are publicly available on BigQuery. We will configure dbt to use a service account
to connect to BigQuery.
